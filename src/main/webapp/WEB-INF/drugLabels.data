Although 4-hydroxyatomoxetine is mainly produced by CYP2D6, 4-hydroxyatomoxetine can be produced by various other cytochrome P450 enzymes in individuals with no CYP2D6 activity, but more slowly. At therapeutic doses, atomoxetine does not inhibit or induce CYP2D6 activity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class\u003d\"blockquote\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInteractions\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class\u003d\"blockquote\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCYP2D6 inhibitors (SSRI\u0027s (e.g. fluoxetine, paroxetine), quinidine, terbinafine): Atomoxetine is mainly metabolized by CYP2D6 to 4-hydroxyatomoxetine. In patients with strong metabolization by CYP2D6 (\u0026quot;extensive metabolizer\u0026quot;), selective CYP2D6 inhibitors may increase atomoxetine steady-state plasma concentration to a level similar to that observed in patients with weak metabolization by CYP2D6 (\u0026quot;poor metabolizer\u0026quot;). In patients with pronounced metabolism who are treated simultaneously with paroxetine or fluoxetine, both the AUC of atomoxetine (about 6 to 8 times) and the steady state levels (3 to 4 times) are elevated compared to patients who are treated only with atomoxetine. Slower titration of atomoxetine may be necessary in patients taking CYP2D6 inhibitors at the same time. If a CYP2D6 inhibitory substance is prescribed or discontinued after the maintenance dose of atomoxetine has been defined, clinical efficacy and tolerability should be reassessed and the dose adjusted for the patient if necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class\u003d\"blockquote\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaution should be exercised when patients with poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 are taking atomoxetine at the same time as substances that can inhibit other cytochrome P450 enzymes in addition to CYP2D6, as there is a risk of increasing the concentration of atomoxetine plasma.

The hydrolysis of the amide group leading to the carboxylic acid metabolite is supported by hepatic and extrahepatic amidase (EC3.5.1.4). In vitro, the hydroxylation of brivaracetam is mediated mainly by CYP2C19. In vivo, the production of the hydroxy metabolite in human volunteers with ineffective CYP2C19 mutations is reduced by two or ten times, with Brivaracetam AUC increased by 22% and 42%, respectively, in volunteers with one or both alleles with loss of function compared to volunteers with wild-type enzymes. Therefore, CYP2C19 inhibitors are unlikely to have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of brivaracetam. Another metabolite (the hydroxy acid metabolite) is produced predominantly by hydroxylation of the propyl side chain of the carboxylic acid metabolite (mainly by CYP2C9). The AUC of the hydroxy, acid and hydroxy acid metabolites correspond to 10%, 8% and 2% respectively of the parent substance.

Population pharmacokinetic analyses of Phase 3 data indicated that on average PMs have 55% higher steady-state exposure than EMs. However, there is considerable overlap between the ranges of exposures seen in EM and PM populations and clinical experience confirms that there are no special dosing requirements for PMs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the complete product monograph text with sections containing pharmacogenetic information highlighted, see the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://api.pharmgkb.org/v1/download/file/attachment/Darifenacin_HCSC_05_22_15.pdf\"\u003edarifenacin product monograph\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Disclaimer: The contents of this page have not been endorsed by HCSC and are the sole responsibility of PharmGKB.\u003c/p\u003e\n"},"xrefs":[]}

The enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) plays an essential role in the degradation of 5-fluorouracil. Nucleoside analogues such as brivudine and its analogues are potent, irreversible inhibitors of the enzyme DPD and can therefore lead to a strong increase in the plasma concentration of 5-fluorouracil with the consequence of toxic reactions (leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, etc.) with a potentially lethal outcome. A time interval of at least 4 weeks must therefore be observed between treatment with Brivudin or comparable drugs and the start of therapy with Ancotil (see \u0026quot;Contraindications\u0026quot;). If necessary, the determination of DPD enzyme activity is indicated before starting treatment with Ancotil, as patients with genetically reduced DPD activity (approx. 0.1-3.0% of the Caucasian population) are more at risk of such interaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the complete drug label text with pharmacogenetic information highlighted, see the \u003ca rel\u003d\"noopener noreferrer\" href\u003d\"https://amiko.oddb.org/de/fi?gtin\u003d40467\u0026amp;highlight\u003dgenetisch\" target\u003d\"_blank\"\u003eflucytosin drug label\u003c/a\u003e (in German).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Disclaimer: The contents of this page have not been endorsed by Swissmedic and are the sole responsibility of PharmGKB.\u003c/p\u003e\n"},"xrefs":[]}

In patients of homozygous genotype 2R/2R the probability of grade 3-4 toxicity is 20 times higher and in patients of heterozygous genotype 2R/3R 6 times higher than in patients of homozygous genotype 3R/3R.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the complete drug label text with pharmacogenetic information highlighted, see the \u003ca rel\u003d\"noopener noreferrer\" href\u003d\"https://amiko.oddb.org/de/fi?gtin\u003d65688\u0026amp;highlight\u003dGenotyp\" target\u003d\"_blank\"\u003efluorouracil drug label\u003c/a\u003e (in German).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Disclaimer: The contents of this page have not been endorsed by Swissmedic and are the sole responsibility of PharmGKB.\u003c/p\u003e\n"},"xrefs":[]}

Such individuals are referred to as “poor metabolizers” of drugs such as debrisoquin, dextromethorphan, and the TCAs. In a study involving labeled and unlabeled enantiomers administered as a racemate, these individuals metabolized S- fluoxetine at a slower rate and thus achieved higher concentrations of S-fluoxetine. Consequently, concentrations of S-norfluoxetine at steady state were lower. The metabolism of R-fluoxetine in these poor metabolizers appears normal. When compared with normal metabolizers, the total sum at steady state of the plasma concentrations of the 4 active enantiomers was not significantly greater among poor metabolizers. Thus, the net pharmacodynamic activities were essentially the same. Alternative, nonsaturable pathways (non-2D6) also contribute to the metabolism of fluoxetine.

One other kinase TNK2 was inhibited at approximately 100-fold higher concentration. TRKA, B, and C are encoded by the genes NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3.Chromosomal rearrangements involving in-frame fusions of these genes with various partners can result in constitutively-activated chimeric TRK fusion proteins that can act as an oncogenic driver, promoting cell proliferation and survival in tumor cell lines.\nIn in vitro and in vivo tumor models, larotrectinib demonstrated anti-tumor activity in cells with constitutive activation of TRK proteins resulting from gene fusions, deletion of a protein regulatory domain, or in cells with TRK protein overexpression. Larotrectinib had minimal activity in cell lines with point mutations in the TRKA kinase domain, including the clinically identified acquired resistance mutation, G595R.

With retard formulations of metoprolol, maximum plasma concentrations are reached after about 4 - 5 h. The plasma concentration of metoprolol is reduced to a minimum. In the dosage range between 50 mg and 200 mg, the plasma concentration of metoprolol increases approximately proportionally to the dose.\nDue to the strong first-pass effect in the liver, only about 50% of a single oral dose of metoprolol enters the systemic circulation. The pre-systemic elimination of metoprolol is individually and differently pronounced due to genetic differences in oxidative metabolism.

This has less importance than usual, however, because the metabolites, including the hydroxyl metabolite and glucuronides (the predominant circulating metabolites), contribute to ß-blocking activity. Plasma levels of d–nebivolol increase in proportion to dose in EMs and PMs for doses up to 20mg. Exposure to l-nebivolol is higher than to d-nebivolol but l-nebivolol contributes little to the drug’s activity as d-nebivolol’s beta receptor affinity is \u0026gt; 1000-fold higher than l-nebivolol.

In patients with severe liver dysfunction, Votrient is contraindicated (see \u0026quot;Contraindications\u0026quot;). Caution and close monitoring are required when administering Votrient to patients with mild to moderate liver dysfunction. During treatment with Votrient, the intake of drugs or substances with known hepatotoxicity should be avoided. In patients with moderate liver dysfunction, a reduced dose of 200 mg Votrient once daily is recommended (see \u0026quot;Dosage/Application\u0026quot;). There is not enough data available for patients with a mild liver dysfunction to make a dose adjustment recommendation. In clinical studies with Votrient, an increase in serum transaminases (ALAT, ASAT) and bilirubin was observed (see \u0026quot;Adverse effects\u0026quot;). In the majority of cases, an isolated increase in ALAT and ASAT without simultaneous increase in alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin was reported. Patients over 60 years of age may have a higher risk of increasing ALAT to \u0026gt;3× ULN. Patients who carry the HLA-B*57:01 allele also have a higher risk of votrient-induced ALT elevation.

Fourteen primary metabolic pathways were identified, of which O-demethylation and N-dealkylation are the most important.

Since its absorption is not affected by food, Risperidone can be taken with or independently of meals. Absolute bioavailability is 66% for rapid metabolizers and 82% for slow metabolizers. CYP 2D has a genetic (debrisoquine/dextromethorphan) polymorphism. Rapid metabolizers rapidly convert risperidone to 9-hydroxy-risperidone, while slow metabolizers do so more slowly. Fast metabolizers therefore have lower risperidone and higher 9-hydroxy-risperidone concentrations in plasma than slow metabolizers. Since risperidone and 9-hydroxy-risperidone have approximately the same antipsychotic activity, the sum of their concentrations is decisive.

The clearance of Sertindol decreases with repeated administration to about 14 l/hour (in women the apparent clearance is about 20% lower than in men, although the clearance values corrected to lean body mass are comparable). Therefore, due to an increase in systemic bioavailability, the accumulation after repeated administration is higher than would be expected after extrapolation of single dose results. Nevertheless, in steady state clearance is dose-independent and plasma concentrations are dose-proportional. Due to the polymorphism of cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) there is a moderate interindividual variability of the pharmacokinetics of Sertindol. The Sertindol clearance values of patients lacking this liver enzyme are only half or one third of those of good CYP2D6 metabolizers. In these poor metabolizers (up to 10% of the population) plasma levels will therefore be two to three times normal.

Since the Chinese were the only Asian population included in this clinical trial, simvastatin should be prescribed with caution in Asian patients and the lowest necessary dose should be used.\nReduced function of transport proteins:\nThe decreased function of the hepatic OATP transport protein may increase the systemic exposure to simvastatin acid, as well as the risk for myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Decreased function may result from inhibition by interacting drugs (e.g., ciclosporin) or may occur in patients carrying the SLCO1B1 c.521T\u0026gt;C genotype.\nPatients carrying the allele c.521T\u0026gt;C of the SLCO1B1 gene encoding a less active OATP1B1 protein have increased systemic exposure to simvastatin acid and increased risk of myopathy. The risk of myopathy caused by high-dose simvastatin (80 mg) is generally 1% without genetic testing. Based on the results of the SEARCH study, carriers of the homozygous C allele (also called CC) treated with 80 mg have a 15% risk of myopathy within one year, while carriers of the heterozygous C allele (CT) have a 1.5% risk. Patients with the most common genotype (TT) have a risk of 0.3% (see \u0026quot;Pharmacokinetics\u0026quot;).

As the polymorphism for CYP2D6 is usually not known outside clinical studies, tamsulosin should not be used together with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the complete drug label text with pharmacogenetic information highlighted, see the \u003ca rel\u003d\"noopener noreferrer\" href\u003d\"https://amiko.oddb.org/de/fi?gtin\u003d57160\u0026amp;highlight\u003dmetabolisern\" target\u003d\"_blank\"\u003etamsulosin drug label\u003c/a\u003e (in German).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Disclaimer: The contents of this page have not been endorsed by Swissmedic and are the sole responsibility of PharmGKB.\u003c/p\u003e\n"},"xrefs":[]}

A comparable distribution volume was observed in extensive (representing the majority of patients) and weak CYP2D6 metabolizers.

In weak CYP2D6 metabolisers, direct glucuronidation of vernacalant is a more important pathway. The main metabolites circulating in human plasma were the glucuronic acid conjugate of 4-O-demethylated vernacalant (in extensive metabolizers) and the glucuronic acid conjugate of vernacalant itself (in weak metabolizers), neither of which is pharmacologically active.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class\u003d\"blockquote\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElimination: After application of an intravenous dose of 240 mg (C)-labelled vernacalant in healthy volunteers, about 93% and 7% of the radioactivity administered to extensive metabolizers was excreted in urine and faeces, respectively. The recovery rate in weak metabolizers was 82% in urine (this slightly lower recovery rate is probably due to incomplete urine sample collection in one of the weak metabolizers) and 6% in faeces. The excretion of unmodified vernacalant in urine averaged about 8% in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers and 23% in weak metabolizers. Extensive metabolizers had higher levels of 4-O-demethylated vernacalant in glucuronidated form in urine, whereas weak metabolizers had higher levels of vernacalant and glucuronidated vernacalant. Therefore, the elimination of vernacalant in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers is predominantly by CYP2D6-mediated O-demethylation, whereas in weak metabolizers it is by direct glucuronidation and renal excretion.\nIn patients, the typical total clearance of vernacalant from the body was estimated to be 0.41 l/h/kg. The mean elimination half-life of vernakalant in patients was approximately 3 hours (extensive CYP2D6 metabolizer) and approximately 5.5 hours (weak metabolizer).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class\u003d\"blockquote\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePharmacokinetics of specific patient groups: A population kinetic analysis suggests that the CYP2D6 metabolisation status influences the clearance of vernacalant. Nevertheless, the acute exposure of vernacalant (AUC) to weak metabolizers at the recommended clinical dose is only 15.2% higher and the average plasma peak concentrations (C) only 8.1% higher than in extensive metabolizers. Therefore, dose adjustment is not necessary due to the CYP2D6 metabolisation status.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the complete drug label text with pharmacogenetic information highlighted, see the \u003ca rel\u003d\"noopener noreferrer\" href\u003d\"https://amiko.oddb.org/de/fi?gtin\u003d61304\u0026amp;highlight\u003dMetabolisierer\" target\u003d\"_blank\"\u003evernakalant drug label\u003c/a\u003e (in German).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Disclaimer: The contents of this page have not been endorsed by Swissmedic and are the sole responsibility of PharmGKB.\u003c/p\u003e\n"},"xrefs":[]}
